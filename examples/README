# Examples

The example in `sim_timing_analyzer.grc` can be used to verify the functionality
of the correlator-based timing alignment analyzer. This flowgraph reads an LTE
waveform from a file in the `data` directory and generates two signals based on
the waveform. One of the two signals is time-delayed by a specified amount, such
that the two signals are not perfectly time-aligned. The remaining blocks of the
flowgraph, in turn, analyze the timing alignment error between the two simulated
signals.
